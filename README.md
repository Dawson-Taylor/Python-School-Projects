# Python School Projects

# First Big Warm Up
 This is a guessing game where you guess a number between 1 and 10. If you guess 
 the wrong number it will let you know if you are greater than or lesser than the 
 random number that the program generated.

# Project
 Our project was to make a text-based adventure game in PyCharm and I decided to make one about a neanderthal.
 You have to collect all of the items and defeat the mammoth or else the mammoth defeats you and ruins your camp.
